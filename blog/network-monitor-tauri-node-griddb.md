# Building a Desktop WiFi Network Monitor with Tauri, React, Node.js, and GridDB

## Introduction

- Hook: Start with a relatable problem or a provocative question.
- Introduce the main topic: "Building a Desktop WiFi Network Monitor."
- Briefly mention the technologies involved (Tauri, React, Node.js, and GridDB).

## Why We Need a Custom WiFi Monitor

- **Problem Statement**
  - Describe the challenges of monitoring WiFi networks.
  - Explain why existing solutions might not be sufficient.

- **Benefits of a Custom Solution**
  - Discuss the advantages of building a tailored network monitor.
  - Highlight the benefits of using Tauri, React, Node.js, and GridDB.

## System Architecture

## Capture Network Traffic

Capturing network traffic using Node.js typically involves native modules that interface with system-level libraries like `libpcap` (on Unix-like systems) or `WinPcap/Npcap` (on Windows). For this post, we will be using Windows OS.

### Install Npcap

[Npcap](https://npcap.com/) is a packet capture and sending library for Microsoft Windows. We need to install this software first so that later we can use it with the node.js npm package, such as [`cap`](https://github.com/mscdex/cap), to perform packet capturing.

To download Npcap, please visit [their site](https://npcap.com/#download) and choose the appropriate installer type for a hassle-free installation. Upon installation, leave every option at its default.

## Backend Development with Node.js and GridDB

### Node.js

Node.jsÂ® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. Download the Windows installer from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). We will use the Node.js LTS v18.18.0 version. There many ways to install Node.js in Windows, please look into their [documentation](https://nodejs.dev/en/). We can use 3rd party Windows package installer such as [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or use the manual installation.

You can check the Node.js installation in the terminal with running this command:

```shell
node --version
```


- **Frontend Development with React**
  - Discuss the project structure, components, and integration with the backend.
- **Desktop Integration using Tauri**
  - Detail the process of turning your web app into a desktop application with Tauri.

## Demonstrating the Results
